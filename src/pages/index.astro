			I'm Carolina Cuadra Pardo, a recent graduate from the University of Leeds MSc High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering. The projects I have carried out in my MSc, as well as my other personal projects, have honed my skills in understanding the development of key aspects of game engines, 
understanding complex rendering techniques, and implementing mesh processing algorithms. Notable projects include creating the Reina Engine, a game engine built from scratch in C++, in which I was mostly responsible for the animation and collision detection systems; developing a renderer using Vulkan with physically inspired shading models,
as well as my MSc Thesis – an implementation of a surface reconstruction from point cloud pipeline, inclduing Marching Cubes with an interactive UI, and a mesh simplification step.<br>
I have experience with key tools such as RenderDoc, and graphics APIs – Vulkan and OpenGL. I take pride in being a good problem solver which tackles problems systematically, especially considering debug outputs and test modes which are so important in rendering and graphics.
Besides videogames, I am very interested in the latest graphics techniques and keep up to date with the current research (SIGGRAPH, Eurographics, GDC, REAC). I am always on the look for new techniques to test and implement.<br>


     I am in the process of building this site so some sections might be empty. Sorry for the inconvenience.
